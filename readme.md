Elgg Geo Tools
================

Various tools intended to simplify location-aware development

[My phone bill is due!](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=P7QA9CFMENBKA)


## Dependencies

* If downloading from github, install composer dependencies by running ```composer install```


## MySQL Spatial Extentions

* The plugin optimizes the storage of geographical coordinates by adding a
geometry-enabled ```prefix_entity_geometry``` table, with a unique ```entity_guid``` key.
Whenever ```location``` metadata is updated, the metadata value is geocoded, and
corresponding coordinates are stored in the geometry-enabled table. This allows
to reduce the overhead, necessary to sort entities by distance to a given
geographical point, or to select entities within certain bounds

* When you first activate the plugin, the script will iterate through all
entities that have ```geo:lat``` and ```geo:long``` metadata attached to them,
and populate the geometry table

* Default Elgg workflow for storing and updating metadata is left unchanged,
so it is safe to disable the plugin at any time without loosing any data


## Filtering

The plugins provides API for getting entities by proximity to a certain geographical point,
as well as convenience functions to adding necessary clauses to your ```elgg_get_entities_*```
options array;

For a sample implementation see, the search hooks.


## Location-based search

The plugin implements location-based search type, where entities within a given radius
are shown in the search results and ordered by proximity to the search query
if it's a geocodeable location


## Geocoding

* Geocoding is performed via multiple providers using PHP Geocoder library by William Durand
https://github.com/geocoder-php/Geocoder

* Configuration for individual providers is available in the plugin settings

* Geocoded addresses/locations will be cached in ```prefix_geocode_cache```


## Geographic Calculations

* Geographic calculations are  performed using Navigator class by Simon Holywell
http://simonholywell.com/projects/navigator/



## Views

The plugin adds several views, which make it easier to standardize location-aware UI:

### Form Views

* ```forms/geo/postal_address``` - standard postal address form (submits an array with a configurable name)
The action will receive an array with the following keys: ```street_address```,
```extended_address```, ```locality```, ```region```, ```postal_code```, ```country_code```


### Input Views

* ```input/geo/location``` - location input with an autocomplete (from existing location metadata)
elgg_tokeninput input is required for autocomplete https://github.com/hypeJunction/elgg_tokeninput

* ```input/geo/country``` - country selector (passes ISO codes as option values)

### Output Views

* ```output/geo/location```
* ```output/geo/country```

## Examples

The following example will display a list of users within a 200km radius to the
current user, and order them by proximity.
Please note that this example assumes that you have properly geocoded details
of the currently logged in user

```php

$current_user = elgg_get_logged_in_user_entity();
$lat = $current_user->getLatitude();
$long = $current_user->getLongitude();

$radius = 200 * 100; // 200km in meters

$params = array(
	'types' => 'user',
	'full_view' => false,
	// other getter and lister options
);

$params = \hypeJunction\Geo\add_distance_constraint_clauses($params, $lat, $long, 200000);
$params = \hypeJunction\Geo\add_order_by_proximity_clauses($params, $lat, $long);

echo elgg_list_entities($params);

```

The following example will display a list of blogs and bookmarks within a
500 meter radius to an address in a default order (time_created).

```php

$location = "Potsdamerstr. 56, Berlin";

$coords = elgg_geocode_location($location);
$lat = $coords['latitude'];
$long = $coords['longitude'];

$params = array(
	'types' => 'object',
	'subtypes' => array('blog','bookmarks'),
	'full_view' => false,
	// other getter and lister options
);

$params = \hypeJunction\Geo\add_distance_constraint_clauses($params, $lat, $long, 500);

echo elgg_list_entities($params);
```

The following example will display a list of 20 featured groups closest to another entity:

```php

$guid = get_input('guid');
$entity = get_entity($guid);

if (elgg_instanceof($entity)) {
	$lat = $entity->getLatitude();
	$long = $entity->getLongitude();
}

if ($lat && $long) {
	$options = array(
		'types' => 'group',
		'metadata_name_value_pairs' => array(
			'name' => 'featured_group', 'value' => 'yes'
		),
		'limit' => 20
	);

	$entities = \hypeJunction\Geo\get_entities_by_proximity($options, $lat, $long, 'elgg_get_entities_from_metadata');
	echo elgg_view_entity_list($entities, array(
		'pagination' => false,
		'full_view' => false
	));
}

```
